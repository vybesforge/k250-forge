#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
  k250-forge one-click start (portable ZIP edition).

  Run by the bundled Start-K250.cmd (which calls this with
  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, since many Windows boxes refuse scripts by default).

  What it does:
    * refuses to run from a folder you don't own (same preflight as install.ps1)
    * builds the venv + bleak on first run by delegating to the repo's install.ps1
    * leaves your limits file alone (install.ps1 never overwrites limits.json)
    * starts the launcher bound to 127.0.0.1:6969 and opens your browser on it
    * Ctrl+C (or closing the window) stops the launcher

  Nothing here writes outside this folder, edits PATH or touches the registry.
