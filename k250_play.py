"""K250-4S Manual-mode pattern engine.

In Manual mode the Power Multiplier (PW) is the only continuous control, so a
"pattern" here is a time-series of PW values. MA = Link Delay (Sec) in this
mode; the Reverse Polarity Switch is box-only (not in the BLE protocol).

VALUE SCALE: PW is 0..10000 on the box. This tool speaks PERCENT (1% = 100).
So --peak 30 sends PW=3000.

Usage:
  python k250_play.py <pattern> --base 18 --peak 26 --secs 30
  patterns: tide stutter trap climb dice edge

Safety: every run ends with PW=0, SIGINT sends PW=0 immediately, and a hard
--hardcap (default 100%) refuses to write above it.
