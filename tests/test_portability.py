"""Portability: nothing in the shipped code may point at the author's machine.

Also guards the Windows installer's invariants: install.ps1 must gate on `import bleak` rather
than a hardcoded Python floor, must not edit the PATH or the registry (the docs promise it
doesn't), and must refuse a directory the user cannot write to — that is the failure that reads
as three unrelated errors from a protected folder.

Regression guard for a real one: `tests/test_pattern_change.py` had
`sys.path.insert(0, '/home/<user>/k250')` — the author's own working directory, hardcoded. It ran
fine on that box and raised `ModuleNotFoundError: k250_play` for everyone else, which meant the one
test guarding the pattern-change rule (the rule that used to silently zero channels) was the one
test that never ran on a fresh clone. Found by an agent doing a clean macOS checkout.

The rule this enforces: code may derive a path from `__file__`/`BASH_SOURCE`, or from an env var
(`K250_DIR`, `K250_PY`, `K250_LIMITS`), or fall back to `$HOME`-relative — never bake in a
particular user's home directory.
