  k250-forge installer for Windows -- builds the venv, installs bleak, writes you a limits file
  to edit, and proves the engine runs before handing over.

      .\install.ps1

  Nothing here needs admin, and nothing here edits your PATH or the registry. Everything it
  writes lives in this folder; it adds no files of its own.

  If PowerShell refuses to run it ("running scripts is disabled on this system"), bypass the
  policy for this one run:

      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1

  Why there is no wrapper step here, unlike install.sh on Linux and macOS: bin/ is bash. On
  Windows you call the engine directly, and it reads limits.json itself, so the ceiling and the
  session budget are enforced exactly as they are through the wrapper.
