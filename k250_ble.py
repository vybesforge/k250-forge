# `--limits-show`, the launcher's pattern list, a status read with no box present —
# was paying it for nothing. Same reasoning as the fast discovery: a driver's idle
# path should stay cheap, especially on modest hardware.

    This used to be a flat `BleakScanner.discover(timeout=12)`, and a discovery
    scan does not return early — it waits out the whole clock even when the box
    is sitting right there advertising. That was the twelve seconds of silence
    before every pattern started, in every tool, because they all call this.
    A filter scan returns as soon as the advertisement matches (typically 1-2 s).

    The slow path is kept only for the case the filter can miss — a BlueZ scan
    race or an odd adapter — and it is NOT run after a clean timeout, or a box
    that is asleep would cost double the wait.

    `address` lets a caller pin one device (from the page's BLE picker); when
    given, only that address matches. Additive — the default finds by name as
    before.
